# Interview prep

This repo is my playground for data structures and algorithms.

I've made it public to serve as an example of my style of coding
(and maybe some analytical skills or technical knowledge, but mostly
style).

For example, I tend to favor readability over everything else
and like making unit tests go from red to green.

## Some highlights:

- mockist vs. classicist TDD in [`4_7.test.ts`](./4_trees_graphs/4_7.test.ts#L164)
