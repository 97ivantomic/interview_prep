# Interview prep

This repo is my playground for data structures and algorithms.

Due a lack of an actual open-source project to share, I've made this
one public to serve as an example of my coding style (and maybe of some analytical skills or technical knowledge, but mostly style).

For example, I tend to favor readability over everything else
and like making unit tests go from red to green.

## Some highlights:

- mockist vs. classicist TDD in [`4_7.test.ts`](./4_trees_graphs/4_7.test.ts#L164)
